# Challenge 14, NY Citibike with Tableau

## Project Overview
In this chellenge, we'll work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. 
Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we want to format our story so it's persuasive! We'll also want to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.

The goals of this challenge are to:

- Display data professionally and accurately.
- Professionally style a Tableau story.
- Utilize previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
- Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike sharing company in Des Moines.

We'll focus on two parameters to build our story: Population, and Gender diversity

- Introduction: visualizes the population in US states based on 2018 census data using Tableau map layer tool. The bar chart include updated info according to 2019 data extracted from [NYC](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NY) and [Des Moines](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/desmoinescityiowa) census data.

- NYC Population: depicts the total bike users versus total population in NYC. A total of 12% of the NYC population used Citi bikes in August 2019.

- Des Moines Population: estimates the total bike users in Des Moines assuming the "12%" usage rate is consistent between NYC and Des Moines.

- Gender Distribution: plots the gender distribution in both cities, and estimates the the bike user breakdown for Des Moines.

- Peak Hour: depicts the bikes' peak hour usage in NYC. Similar peak hours can be observed among the genders. However, there is meaningful difference in bike utilization among males and females in midnight hours. This could be related to crime rate in those hours. We'll investigate that in the next page.

- Crime Rate: crime rate info were extracted from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate). Des Moines has a significant higher crime rate in all cime categories compared to NYC. decision makers should plan for the safety of bike users participating in bike-sharing program.

- Trip Duration: shows the average trip duration per gender in NYC. The average trip duration is higher in female compared to males in NYC. This results could have been different if we had more info on "unknown" gender data. However, in general, women are more likely to make multiple stops in a single outgoing. This could possibly result in higher average trip duration in females compared t males.
